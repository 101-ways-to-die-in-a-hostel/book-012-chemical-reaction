# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Theodore "Teddy" Whitman III
**Nickname/Handle:** @TeddyTravelsClean
**Age:** 31
**Nationality:** American (Connecticut)
**Occupation:** Former pharmaceutical sales rep, now "taking a year off"

## Archetype
**Primary:** OCD/Anxiety Traveler (Clean Freak subtype)

**Secondary traits:** Trust fund kid, germaphobe, control obsessive

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Obsession (specifically, pathological need for cleanliness and control)

**How it manifests:**
- Carries a suitcase full of cleaning supplies
- Cannot sleep until his immediate environment meets his standards
- Spends first hours at any accommodation cleaning it himself
- Sees other travelers as vectors of contamination

**How it kills them:**
His compulsion to clean an "unacceptable" bathroom leads him to mix incompatible chemicals in an enclosed space, creating toxic gas.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'11", thin, always appears tense
- **Hair:** Brown, precisely cut, always seems freshly washed
- **Distinguishing features:** Red, raw hands from excessive washing; always wears latex gloves; carries hand sanitizer on lanyard
- **Typical outfit:** Wrinkle-free performance fabric clothing in neutral colors, always appears freshly laundered

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Detail-oriented - becomes obsessive cataloging of perceived contamination
2. Prepared - becomes over-reliance on products rather than adaptation

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Rigid thinking - cannot adjust cleaning routine despite different circumstances
2. Dismissive of warnings - assumes he knows better than locals about hygiene

### Pet Peeves
- Shared bathrooms (ironic: dies in one)
- Other people's hair (will find some in the drain)
- Damp towels, humid air, mold, mildew, anything "organic"

### Fears
- Surface fear: Contamination, disease, other people's germs
- Deeper fear: Loss of control, that his rituals won't protect him

## Background

### Origin Story
Teddy grew up in a wealthy Connecticut family where appearances mattered more than feelings. His mother was a perfectionist who taught him that disorder equaled failure. His OCD emerged in adolescence, channeled into cleaning rituals that gave him a sense of control. His family paid for therapy but were embarrassed by his "quirks." He excelled in pharmaceutical sales precisely because he understood contamination anxiety—he could sell anything to anyone worried about germs.

### Why They Travel
His therapist suggested exposure therapy: face the uncontrollable, embrace the messy. Teddy interpreted this as "bring enough supplies to make the world clean." He's not running from anything; he's trying to prove he can handle anything—as long as he can control it.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Budget constraints (his parents cut him off after six months), combined with a masochistic urge to test himself. He chose the hostel specifically because reviews mentioned "rustic" and "authentic"—code words that terrified and attracted him. He planned to clean his way to victory.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "sanitize," "contamination vector," "acceptable parameters," "hygiene protocol"
- Avoids words like: "dirt," "filthy" (triggers anxiety), "relax" (impossible)
- Catchphrases: "I'll just give this a quick wipe," "You never know what's been there"

### Speech Pattern
- Clipped, efficient sentences
- Often trails off when noticing something unclean
- Mutters to himself during cleaning rituals
- Formal, slightly old-fashioned phrasing (Connecticut prep school)

### Internal Monologue Style
Anxious cataloging. Constant risk assessment. Every surface is evaluated. Every person is a potential contamination source. The mental chatter never stops.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (carefully curated "clean travel" aesthetic)
- **Follower count:** 8,200 (niche audience of fellow germaphobes)
- **Posting style:** Before/after cleaning shots, product reviews, "safe" restaurant recommendations
- **Last post before death:** Photo of his cleaning supply kit laid out on a (clean) towel: "Ready for anything. Marrakech, you're next."

### Online vs Reality
Online: Confident clean-travel expert helping others stay safe
Reality: Anxious mess who spends half his trip cleaning rather than experiencing

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents: Disapproving, embarrassed by his "issues," recently cut off financial support
- Sister: Only person who understands, texts daily, genuinely worried about him

### Friends
- Acquaintances only; his cleaning habits alienate people quickly
- Online friends in OCD support forums—never met in person

### Romantic
- Single; contamination anxiety extends to intimacy
- Has never successfully dated; convinced he's "not relationship material"

### At the Hostel
- Immediately conflicts with laid-back guests who don't understand his cleaning
- Staff find him exhausting but fascinating
- One guest (Swedish backpacker) tries to befriend him; he's too anxious to reciprocate

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 5 AM to clean bathroom before others use it. Discovers it was "contaminated" overnight. Spends two hours making it acceptable. Skips breakfast. Anxiety building.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Sitting in the common room, latex gloves on, reading reviews of his next destination. A brief moment of peace before he remembers the bathroom will need recleaning.

### Final Thoughts
"The fumes—something's wrong—the ventilation—I calculated wrong—Mom was right—I can't control—"

### Last Words
"Help—can't—breathe—" (barely audible through bathroom door)

## Writing This Character

### POV Notes
When in this character's head:
- They notice: Every surface, every stain, every potential source of contamination
- They ignore: Beauty, culture, connection—anything that isn't a threat assessment
- They judge: Everyone by their hygiene standards (and everyone falls short)

### Key Scenes Checklist
- [ ] Introduction scene establishing archetype (unpacking cleaning supplies while roommates watch in disbelief)
- [ ] Fatal flaw demonstration (early) (refusing to touch doorknob, elaborate hand-washing ritual)
- [ ] Sympathetic moment (make reader care) (phone call with sister revealing the scared person beneath the compulsions)
- [ ] Warning ignored scene (staff tells him the chemicals shouldn't be mixed; he dismisses them)
- [ ] Point of no return (locks bathroom door, pours the second cleaner)
- [ ] The death (chloramine gas poisoning)
