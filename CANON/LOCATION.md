# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Riad Al-Safar
**Type:** Traditional Riad / Budget Hostel
**Star Rating:** 2.5
**Price Range:** 80-150 MAD per night (8-15 USD)

### History
Built in the 1800s as a wealthy merchant's home. Converted to riad guesthouse in the 1970s. Sold multiple times as tourism changed. Current owners (French-Moroccan couple) converted it to hostel in 2018, keeping traditional architecture while adding dorm beds. The building has survived floods, earthquakes, and generations of questionable maintenance.

### Architecture
- **Style:** Traditional Moroccan riad—central courtyard with rooms around it, no exterior windows
- **Floors:** 2 (plus rooftop terrace)
- **Total beds:** 32
- **Notable features:** Intricate zellige tilework (original, chipped), carved plaster arches, central fountain (dry), rooftop with medina views

### Layout
```
Ground Floor:
- Entrance corridor (long, dark, narrow)
- Central courtyard (open to sky, fountain centerpiece)
- Reception nook
- Communal kitchen (basic)
- Two shared bathrooms (small, interior, no windows)
- One 4-bed mixed dorm

First Floor:
- Gallery overlooking courtyard

```

### The Death Location (Specific)
First-floor shared bathroom. Approximately 2x2 meters. No windows. Single overhead light (dim). One toilet, one sink, small drain in floor. Broken exhaust fan (hasn't worked in 8 months). The door locks from inside with a simple turn-lock and key. Tile floor, tile walls—easy to clean, poor ventilation. When the door is closed, it's essentially a sealed chamber.

## The City

**City:** Marrakech
**Country:** Morocco
**Population:** ~1 million

- **Danger level:** Moderate (scams and harassment common, violent crime rare)

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Call to prayer echoing across medina, rooster crows, metal shutters rising
- Afternoon: Hammering from artisan workshops, haggling in souks, motorbikes in narrow alleys
- Night: Drums from Jemaa el-Fnaa, distant music, cats fighting, muezzin's final call
- Unique sounds: The hostel's dry fountain gurgles when someone runs water nearby (unnerving)

### Smells
- Hostel: Incense (staff burns to mask other smells), mint tea, ammonia cleaner, old plaster, cooking spices
- Street: Tagine spices, leather from tanneries, donkey, orange blossoms, diesel
- Specific to death location: Ammonia (strong, recent cleaning), bleach (Teddy's), then chloramine (indescribable, chemical death)

### Textures
- Surfaces: Smooth zellige tiles, rough plaster walls, cool marble, worn wooden doors
- Climate feel: Dry heat during day, cool stone floors, surprisingly cold at night

### Tastes
- Local food: Tagine, couscous, pastilla, mint tea, fresh orange juice, harira soup
- Hostel offerings: Free mint tea, basic breakfast (bread, jam, coffee)

### Visual Details
- Colors: Terracotta, cobalt blue tiles, white plaster, sun-bleached everything, green mint
- Light quality: Harsh sunlight in courtyard, mysterious shadows in corridors, golden lantern light at night
- Distinctive visuals: Geometric tile patterns, arched doorways, the central courtyard's patch of sky, cats everywhere

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Fatima Ouazzani
**Description:** 45, motherly, efficient, speaks four languages. Runs the hostel for the absent French-Moroccan owners. Knows every guest's name and dietary restrictions.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (ignored). Told Teddy directly not to mix his chemicals with their floor cleaner. Shrugged when he dismissed her—she's seen difficult tourists before.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Khadija | Uses ammonia-based cleaner her grandmother used; takes pride in her work |
| Kitchen | Hassan | Part-time, also works at a restaurant; makes the mint tea |
| Handyman | Youssef | Supposed to fix the exhaust fan; hasn't gotten around to it |
| Manager/Owner | The Bellarouis | French-Moroccan couple, live in Casablanca, rarely visit |

### Staff Knowledge
Fatima knows the bathroom ventilation is terrible—she's complained to the owners for months. She knows Teddy is using dangerous chemicals—she warned him. She doesn't know he'll combine them with the ammonia residue from Khadija's morning cleaning. No one suspects what's about to happen.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Lazy and social. Guests lounge in the courtyard, mint tea flows freely. The heat drives people to nap in the afternoon. It feels like a sanctuary from the chaos of the medina.

### Night Vibe
Magical but slightly eerie. Lanterns cast dancing shadows on the zellige tiles. The courtyard becomes a communal living room. The sounds of the medina filter in. The dark corridors feel like they hide secrets.

### Guest Demographics
Classic backpacker mix: European gap year students, American "finding themselves" types, Australian round-the-worlders, occasional older budget travelers. Average age: 24. Average stay: 3-4 nights.

### Reputation
Reviews are mixed: "Authentic experience!" / "Charming but basic" / "Bathroom situation could be better" / "Fatima is an angel." Teddy specifically chose it because of a review that said "rustic but clean enough."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
From Marrakech train station: petit taxi to Jemaa el-Fnaa, then walk through medina (confusing, everyone gets lost). Many guests pay local kids to guide them through the alleys. The hostel door is unmarked except for a small hand of Fatima.

### Check-in Process
Fatima serves mint tea while copying passports. Tour of the riad. Explanation of hammam options nearby. Warning about the medina's confusing layout. Assignment of bed and locker. Gentle mention that the bathroom exhaust doesn't work—open the door when you're done.

### Rules
1. Remove shoes at entrance
2. No alcohol in common areas (Morocco is Muslim-majority)
3. Quiet hours: 23:00-07:00
4. Don't flush toilet paper (plumbing can't handle it)
5. Open bathroom door when finished to air it out

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: acceptable in courtyard, nonexistent in dorms)
- [x] Kitchen (basic)
- [x] Lockers (bring your own lock)
- [ ] Laundry (rooftop lines, hand-wash)
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [x] Rooftop (terrace with cushions)
- [x] Tours offered (Fatima can arrange)
- [x] Other: Free mint tea, traditional atmosphere

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Marrakech medina layout is genuinely confusing; getting lost is part of the experience
- Riads are accurate to description (central courtyard, no exterior windows, multiple floors)
- Moroccan cleaning practices do commonly use ammonia-based products
- Bathroom ventilation in old riads is often poor
- Chemical mixing accidents happen globally; this isn't unique to Morocco

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Morocco is not a "dirty" country—different standards, not lower standards
- Teddy's problem is his rigidity, not Moroccan hygiene
- Staff should be portrayed as competent and caring, not negligent
- Avoid Orientalist tropes; the medina is chaotic but not threatening
- Islamic practices (call to prayer, no alcohol) are cultural context, not exoticism
